# The spark_as_a_service API has been created to trigger an existing Tekton pipeline. The API accepts Python and YAML files in the payload, validates the authorization token using the validate API, and then triggers the Tekton pipeline. The main application has been updated to include the spark_as_a_service API. A Tekton pipeline trigger file has also been created to define the pipeline that will be triggered by the API. This setup ensures that the pipeline is triggered automatically when the API is called with the appropriate payload and authorization token.
